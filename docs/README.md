## Instructions for use
- Navigate to [ùïè/Twitter](https://twitter.com/search-advanced) and perform a search (simple or advanced)
    - It is advised to create a specific account for the purpose of scraping content
- Click the add-on's icon in the toolbar
- Click `Start scraping`
- The interface appears as a layer over the current webpage:
    - (Optional) Set the maximum number of tweets to scrape
    - Choose your preferred output format:
        - `XML/XTZ` for an XML file to import into [TXM](https://txm.gitpages.huma-num.fr/textometrie/en/index.html) using the `XML/TEI-Zero` module
          - When initiating the import process, open the "Textual planes" section and type `ref` in the field labelled "Out of text to edit"
        - `TXT` for plain text
        - `CSV`
        - `XLSX` (Excel spreadsheet)
        - `JSON`
- You can abort at any time
- Click `Download` to collect the output 

## Known issues and limitations
### Too many requests
The add-on collects tweets by automatically scrolling the search results page. This makes repeated calls to the ùïè/Twitter server, which eventually **times out** with a 429 response (Too many requests). When that happens (generally after scraping ~900 tweets), **download the file**, reset, allow a few minutes for the server to 'cool down', then adjust your search parameters to avoid collecting duplicates and resume scraping. 
### Interface redesign
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important!** In v0.2, the add-on's popup window needs to remain open for the extension to behave properly. Clicking outside it, switching to another tab/window, or switching to a different app will cause it to close, effectively preventing the user from interacting with the extension during or after the scraping process.  
**This is addressed in v0.3 through a redesigned interface:** make sure to download the newest version.
### Create an ad-hoc account
Although Elon Musk has repeatedly expressed his opposition to scraping ùïè/Twitter data, collecting publicly available data for research purposes is legal in most countries. However, as a precaution, it is advisable to **create an ad-hoc account** for this specific purpose.
