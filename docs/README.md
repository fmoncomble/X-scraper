### Known issues and limitations
- Elon Musk has repeatedly expressed his opposition to scraping Twitter data, collecting publicly available data for research purposes is legal in most countries. However, as a precaution, it is advisable to create an ad-hoc account for this soecific purpose. 
- The add-on collects tweet by automatically scrolling the search results page. This makes repeated calls to the Twitter server, which eventually times out with a 429 response (Too may requests). When that happens (generally after scraping ~900 tweets), allow a few minutes for the server to 'cool down', then adjust your search parameters to avoid collecting duplicates and resume scraping.
